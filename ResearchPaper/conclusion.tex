\section{Conclusion}
Comparison to previous work. 
Supervised Classification Applied to Road Following(SCARF) use gaussian color model to describe situation. It is useful in road detection as most of road's color are strictly fixed. But there are some problems in adapting algorithms to sidewalk detection. So, we present new algorithm by using line detection and some regression method. To get access with large variety of situation, we use line detection rather than color model. There are some benefits in each ways. If color model don't suit well in given situation, using this algorithm to get more accuracy data is good choice. 
Limitations. Our model are computing by only strict line. If the given situation is so much curved, our model are not much work effectively. And in the situation of too much error, line detecting algorithm could not work properly. And also, our method are mostly do with camera vision. We suggested that there are some ways to compute in using accelerator to get user's actual direction.
